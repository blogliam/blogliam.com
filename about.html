<p class="m"><strong>STAGE 2:</strong> Individual Project Growth -utulize web hosting through central site to show off web-based content and tie it to not only yourself but the entire group</p>
<p class="m"><strong>STAGE 3:</strong> Collaborative Projects -central site hosts collaborative projects with links to behind the scenes on user's blogs</p>
<p class="m"><strong>STAGE 4:</strong> Unified Branding Transcendence -essentially the concept of the "artist collective" -website still hosts blogs but has a centralized focus on collaborative efforts</p>
